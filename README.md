# Use this as a template for your Node.js projects in repl.it

Import this repo to create a starting point for Node.js projects in repl.it, https://replit.com

Store this repo and use it as a template when creating other Node.js files as it has the configuration files that repl.it needs to keep things straight and it has .gitignore files to keep node modules out of your repo.

When you want to start a new Node.js project, IMPORT (don't fork) this repo and name the new repo to suit your project.

Then login to repl.it and when creating a new repl, be sure to select "Import from GitHub" and do not choose a type of project.

Paste in the URL, then begin your project.  The modules you install will stay with the repl.

To push your changes, find the icon that looks like a fork on the left side of the repl.it interface.

When changes have been made, you'll be able to type your changes in and push to the main branch.

The first time you make changes via repl.it's interface, you'll need to give permission to repl.it to make changes on your behalf. 

When I tried to connect to GitHub, there was a screen that asked if I wanted repl.it to have access to all my repos or only a select group.  The submit button was grayed out, I could find no way to make a selection.  

After trying this a couple of times, I ended up clearing what is likely a JS anomaly by clicking the radio button to choose only a specific repo, then back to the all repos repeatedly until the submit button changed color to show it was now working.
